# Midnite3DP Bedpan Modification

Modified from Midnite3DP's design, I had an issue with my wires causing the bucket to sit at an angle. This modification means that the wires can be managed by routing them under with the bedpan sitting level again.

###### BOM

As per original:

4x M3x8 socket head bolts for the wago mount
4x 10x5x3 magnets for the top of the wago mount and cover top/bottom (in New Zealand, I found them at [Magnets New Zealand]( https://www.magnets.co.nz/shop/neodymium/blocks-neodymium/10mm-x-5mm-x-3mm-neodymium-block/))
4x 6x3 magnets for the bucket and wago mount sides

###### Installation

As per the original, no supports etc needed. 

Macro I've been using is available here:
