## Modification list

###### [BTT Smart Filament Sensor Frame Mount](https://github.com/airway38/Voron-Modifications/tree/main/BTT%20SFS%20Frame%20Mount)

Another method to mount the SFS onto the frame.
  
 
###### Midnite3DP Bedpan Modification

Original: https://github.com/Midnite3DP/voron-bedpan
  
I've modified the wago mount to brdige across the gap to provide a tidier solution for cables from the bed. Also adjusted the pan to allow for the extra height added.
